1. We decided to use an abstract class named "Car" instead of an interface class. Abstract classes represent a generlisation of several different subclasses.
Volvo240 and Saab95 are both cars and they have many common methods and variables. Declaring those methods and variables allowed in our abstract class "Car" allowed
us to reduce redundancy.
